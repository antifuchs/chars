# Cha(rs)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/antifuchs/chars.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/antifuchs/chars)

Use this tool to display names and codes for various ASCII (and
unicode) characters / code points!

It's strongly inspired by
[`ascii(1)`](http://www.catb.org/esr/ascii/), but supports unicode
characters; it's also inspired by
[`unicode.py`](http://kassiopeia.juls.savba.sk/~garabik/software/unicode/),
but it attempts to support whitespace/control characters better.

Cha(rs) is currently probably failing at some other edge case, but I
hope not.

## Pronunciation

How do you pronounce "chars"? This is a contentious thing.

## Installation

This package is tested on [circle
CI](https://circleci.com/gh/antifuchs/chars/tree/master) using the
latest stable, beta and nightly releases. Older releases might work,
but I'm focusing development mostly on the latest versions.

### Plain crate installation without source code

`cargo install chars --git https://github.com/antifuchs/chars.git`

### OS packages

**Arch linux:** There's an [AUR package for chars](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chars/).

**Windows:** There's a package available through [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/chars).

### Source installation
1. Clone this repo,
2. `cd` into the checkout,
3. `cargo install --path chars`

## Running

Look up a character by its face value:

`chars '√ü'`

Screenshot:
```
LATIN1 df, 223, 0xdf, 0337, bits 11011111
Width: 1 (2 in CJK context), prints as √ü
Lower case. Upcases to SS
Quotes as \u{df}
Unicode name: LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S
```

Look up a character by its unicode point:

`chars U+1F63C`

Screenshot:
```
U+0001F63C, &#128572; 0x0001F63C, \0373074, UTF-8: f0 9f 98 bc, UTF-16BE: d83dde3c
Width: 1, prints as üòº

Look up a character by ambiguous "char code" handwaving:
